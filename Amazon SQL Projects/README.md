# **Amazon USA Sales Analysis Project**

### **Difficulty Level: Advanced**

---

## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

```sql
CREATE TABLE category
(
  category_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

-- customers TABLE
CREATE TABLE customers
(
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  first_name	VARCHAR(20),
  last_name	VARCHAR(20),
  state VARCHAR(20),
  address VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT ('xxxx')
);

-- sellers TABLE
CREATE TABLE sellers
(
  seller_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  seller_name	VARCHAR(25),
  origin VARCHAR(15)
);

-- products table
  CREATE TABLE products
  (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,	
  product_name VARCHAR(50),	
  price	FLOAT,
  cogs	FLOAT,
  category_id INT, -- FK 
  CONSTRAINT product_fk_category FOREIGN KEY(category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

-- orders
CREATE TABLE orders
(
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 	
  order_date	DATE,
  customer_id	INT, -- FK
  seller_id INT, -- FK 
  order_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_customers FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  CONSTRAINT orders_fk_sellers FOREIGN KEY (seller_id) REFERENCES sellers(seller_id)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items
(
  order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,	-- FK 
  product_id INT, -- FK
  quantity INT,	
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
  CONSTRAINT order_items_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

-- payment TABLE
CREATE TABLE payments
(
  payment_id	
  INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT, -- FK 	
  payment_date DATE,
  payment_status VARCHAR(20),
  CONSTRAINT payments_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE shippings
(
  shipping_id	INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id	INT, -- FK
  shipping_date DATE,	
  return_date	 DATE,
  shipping_providers	VARCHAR(15),
  delivery_status VARCHAR(15),
  CONSTRAINT shippings_fk_orders FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory
(
  inventory_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT, -- FK
  stock INT,
  warehouse_id INT,
  last_stock_date DATE,
  CONSTRAINT inventory_fk_products FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
  );
```

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

---

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:

19. Final Task: Stored Procedure
Create a stored procedure that, when a product is sold, performs the following actions:
Inserts a new sales record into the orders and order_items tables.
Updates the inventory table to reduce the stock based on the product and quantity purchased.
The procedure should ensure that the stock is adjusted immediately after recording the sale.

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_sales
(
p_order_id INT,
p_customer_id INT,
p_seller_id INT,
p_order_item_id INT,
p_product_id INT,
p_quantity INT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE 
-- all variable
v_count INT;
v_price FLOAT;
v_product VARCHAR(50);

BEGIN
-- Fetching product name and price based p id entered
	SELECT 
		price, product_name
		INTO
		v_price, v_product
	FROM products
	WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
	
-- checking stock and product availability in inventory	
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) 
		INTO
		v_count
	FROM inventory
	WHERE 
		product_id = p_product_id
		AND 
		stock >= p_quantity;
		
	IF v_count > 0 THEN
	-- add into orders and order_items table
	-- update inventory
		INSERT INTO orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id)
		VALUES
		(p_order_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

		-- adding into order list
		INSERT INTO order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit, total_sale)
		VALUES
		(p_order_item_id, p_order_id, p_product_id, p_quantity, v_price, v_price*p_quantity);

		--updating inventory
		UPDATE inventory
		SET stock = stock - p_quantity
		WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
		
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you product: % sale has been added also inventory stock updates',v_product; 
	ELSE
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for for your info the product: % is not available', v_product;
	END IF;
END;
